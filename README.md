### This is created by Python Jupyter notebook, however, the notebook is too big to upload to Github
### Here I created PPT and poster to describe my project and the followings are some of the plots I created in this Jupyter Notebook
### If you are interested in how I created the plots or graphs, please send a email to wenhuan.tan@bellevuecollege.edu to get the full coding part
### The data are divided to 4 periods: period 1 - 2001 to 2005; period 2 - 2006 to 2010; period 3 - 2010 to 2015; period 4 - 2016 to 2019

#### This is the Normal Distribution of suicide rates in period-2001 to 2005 in the USA

#### This is plotting the suicide rates of suicide rates in period-2001 to 2005 on the map by using Python Plotly package

### This is to show the suicide increate rates in the different intervals

### This is using a pie graph to show the percentages of counties that suicide rates increased or decreased by comparing period 4 and period 1

### This is using Linear Regression method to see the associations between suicide rates and PM2.5 in period 1-2001 to 2005

### This is using Linear Regression method to see the associations between suicide rates and CO in period 2-2006 to 2010

### This is using Linear Regression method to see the associations between suicide rates and SO2 in period 2-2006 to 2010

### This is using Linear Regression method to see the associations between suicide rates and Ozone  in period 2-2006 to 2010

### This is using a table to show the coefficients of each feature and suicide rates
<img src="https://github.com/Wenhuan2516/Air-Quality-and-Suicides/blob/main/suicide6.png" alt="Suicide distribution" title="Suicide Distribution">

### This is using pairwise correlation method to show the correlations between every two features and each feature with suicide rates
<img src="https://github.com/Wenhuan2516/Air-Quality-and-Suicides/blob/main/suicide10.png" alt="Suicide distribution" title="Suicide Distribution">

### This is using a map to display the suicide increate rate by comparing period 4 to period 1 in the USA
